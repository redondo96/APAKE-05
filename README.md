Implementation of two different versions of APAKE '05 protocol (one as it is and the other with elliptic curves)

One of the most interest-provoking questions in today’s digital society is the privacy and anonymity of users. Between public key cryptographic schemes, anonymous password-based authenticated key exchange schemes can be found, and these have major relevance in this area. These types of protocols are the evolution of key establishment protocols and serve the primary purpose of allowing the users to communicate with the server without needing to reveal their identity –using only a password for individual recognition. In this way, these are versatile protocols that can be useful in any situation where anonymity is required.
